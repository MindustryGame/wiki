# Markup

The text renderer uses a simple markup language for coloring text.

-   `[name]` sets the color by name, there's a few [built-in colors](#built-in-colors);
-   `[#rrggbb]` / `[#rrggbbaa]` sets the color by hex value, with each value being anything from `00` to `ff`:
    -   `rr` is the red value,
    -   `gg` is the green value,
    -   `bb` is the blue value,
    -   `aa` is the alpha value;
-   `[]` sets the color back to the previous color;
-   `[[` escapes the left bracket, so you can write `[[red]` to write and it'll render as `[red]`.

Notes:

-   errors/unknown colors will be silently ignored.

Example:

    [red]red
    [#ff0000]full-red
    [#ff000066]half-red
    [#ff000033]half-half-red
    [#00ff00]green
    []half-half-red
