# Writing and Editing Code

There are two primary methods to writing Mindustry Logic: The Visual Editor and manual editing. Each is better in their own way, so choose whichever works for you the best.

## The Visual Editor

The Visual Editor is the "Editing" interface of a processor (when you press the "pencil" button). **It's the recommended method for beginners**, since it has been designed to be easy to understand and use.

The advantages of editing this way as opposed to editing manually are:

* A block-based, color-coded, drag-and-drop interface
* Easy parameter chooser, shows all of the needed parameters
* Visual, easy-to-set jump relationships
* Mobile-friendly

You can also export and import code to and from text form.

## Manual Editing

Manual editing involves using a text editor such as Notepad++, Vim, or Visual Studio Code to edit your code. **For more advanced users and longer code, manual editing is the way to go**.

The advantages of manually editing code as opposed to the Visual Editor are:

* Denser than the Visual Editor; more code can be seen at a time
* Typing is faster than dragging-and-dropping across long walls of code
* Can be used to make quick pieces of code for demonstration without opening Mindustry
* Syntax highlighting in some editors such as VS Code (by Vortetty on Discord)
* A text block does not block part of the parameter text
* Ability to save and access code outside of Mindustry

However, it can be a little difficult for beginners or those who aren't used to editing code, since variables have to be typed out explicitly, and jumps can get very messy without a visual guide, among other things.
